        <h4>What should I do if I want to come on a walk?</h4>
        <p>
          You should contact us first instance by clicking on the “Contact us” button on our web
          site. We will respond as soon as we can. Let us know that which walk that you want to come
          on before the Thursday before the walk, so that we know to expect you at one of the
          meeting places. If you are an inexperienced walker you should choose one of the easier
          walks to start with.
        </p>
        <h4>What type of walks do you do?</h4>
        <p>
          Our walk programme is described on our website. In general we walk between 8 and 14 miles
          in locations up to a 2 hour drive from Peterborough. The walks cover a range of
          difficulties from flat walking in the Fens to the hills in the Peak District. We arrange
          weekends away where the walking may be more challenging.
        </p>
        <h4>Do I have to join?</h4>
        <p>
          You do not have to join for your first walk. We hope you will come along and see what a
          lovely bunch of people we are before you join.
        </p>
        <h4>Why do you charge for walks?</h4>
        <p>
          The “charge” identified for each walk is an estimate of the shared cost of petrol to drive
          to the walk and back. This cost varies, depending on how many people share a car.
        </p>
        <h4>Do I need a car?</h4>
        <p>
          Our Club relies on members willing to drive to walks which are usually a car ride away. So
          if you have a car, we would hope you would take a turn to drive. Obviously, if none of our
          members had cars that they were happy to use, then we would need to change the type of
          walking we do. Generally we have a sufficient proportion of members who are willing to
          drive so we are happy to welcome non–drivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to find your own way to one of our meeting points. The main meeting place is
          in Peterborough. When we are travelling northwards, we also have a meeting place in
          Stamford and by arrangement, Market Deeping when travelling in that direction.
        </p>
        <h4>What equipment do I need?</h4>
        <p>
          As a minimum we expect you to have some strong walking shoes and some waterproofs. You
          will need some lunch and a drink. In the summer you will need more drink than you think –
          maybe between one and a half and three litres. What you need varies depending on time of
          year and where we are walking.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the average age of members?</h4>
        <p>
          Our age range is from late twenties to seventies, but the majority of our walkers are
          between forty five and sixty five.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I bring my dog?</h4>
        <p>
          You may bring your dog providing you keep it under control and you use you own car to
          transport it. Some members of our group are not comfortable with dogs, so you will need to
          be sensitive to this in controlling your dog.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you walk all year round?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes. Our walks are programmed at regular intervals throughout the year. We will walk in
          any conditions. The only constraint there has been in the past, is where snow and ice is,
          or is forecast to be, so bad that road conditions are too dangerous to travel. In this
          case we might undertake a local walk instead.
