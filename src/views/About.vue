          Walks are led by one of the experienced club members who have led many walks over many
          years. Normally there are about 5 - 10 people on a walk, enough for some good conversation
          without being unwieldy. On walk days, we meet at points in Peterborough and Stamford, so
          that we minimise the cost of the walks. The only charge we make is to cover the cost of
          the fuel. This naturally varies with the number of walkers and the distance we have to
          travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to take part in any of the listed walks then let us know by email 48 hours
          before the walk so that we can arrange cars. Our email address is
          <a href="mailto:peterboroughwalkingclub@gmail.com">peterboroughwalkingclub@gmail.com</a>.
          If subsequently you find that you cannot make it, please give us a ring or text and let us
          know. If this is on the morning of the walk then ring Alan's mobile; telephone numbers are
          in the newsletter.

          Before you join the club you are invited to join us on a walk to see what you think. If
          you aren't an experienced walker re recommend you try one of the easier walks first.
