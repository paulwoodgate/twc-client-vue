        <h4>The Walking Club Mobile Phone Code</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be considerate in the use of the phone to avoid disturbing other walkers.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid use as far as possible whilst walking.</li>
          <li>Set on silent mode if possible.</li>
          <li>
            If you have to make or take a call, drop back out of earshot of other walkers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Walking Club Dog Code</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In general, the Club accepts members bringing their dogs on walks but reserves the right
            to refuse permission at any time for any reason.
          </li>
          <li>
            In accordance with the Country Code, we would expect all dogs to be kept under close
            control. This would include keeping them on a lead when in the proximity of farm animals
            and we would expect them not to disturb or harass wildlife.
          </li>
          <li>There is a limit of one dog per member</li>
          <li>
            If a member is planning to bring a dog on a walk, he/she must let the transport planner
            know when he/she makes contact to confirm they are coming on the walk.
          </li>
          <li>
            The owner would be expected to transport the dog in his/her own vehicle and assistance
            with petrol costs will not be given unless an additional walker or walkers are carried.
            When a dog owner takes his/her own car there is no walk charge - since walk charges are
            mainly to cover fuel costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            For weekends away, members with dogs would need to make their own arrangements.
          </li>
